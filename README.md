Module 10 Challenge files, CWRU Data Analytics Bootcamp
In the "SurfsUp" folder you will find the Jupyter Notebook entitled "climate_starter" which contains the code for the Climate Data Exploration.
Also located in "SurfsUp" is the code for the API in the file "app.py". The "Resources" folder is also located in the "SurfsUp" folder.
I used OpenAi's ChatGpt for debugging of the code, and reminders of how to implement various pieces of code.
